# work-day-scheduler
Challenge 5 

For this week's challenge, I created a work day schedule application that allows users to type their to do's at certain hours of their work day to help increase productivity. The application gives you the current date at the top in month, day, year, hour and minute format. The application displays a color gray when the task is past due, red if the task is due or is meant to be done at that hour, and green if it is still not due. The application also allows you to save the task text content. This application is very helpful for users that need a visual of their daily chores or assignments throughout the day to keep them productive and engaged in their daily life. It is also great for those of us that need an extra tool to help us time manage more effectively.
